# TokenLancer - Freelancing App

TokenLancer is a Freelancing app made with react native.

## What is TokenLancer ? 

We have heard about tokenizing many things, a lot of valuable things. But when we paused for a second and deliberate upon it for a short while, it might be evident that the most valuable asset any person could have is their time. That got us started with a mission of tokenizing time and applying it to the freelancing world. In out protocol a freelancer is permitted to tokenizer his/her time and allocate it to the hirers accordingly. We call them TokenLancers (Who work using TokenLancer platform).
